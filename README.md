TOP: Landing Page (FlexBox Project)

Before starting project:
First attempt at recreating a website from an image. Goal is to try to accomplish the structural parts with flexbox and style the page according to the manual. 

The aim of this project is to consolidate my knowledge in HTML, CSS and FlexBox. Especially, to focus on layout and positioning of elements with FlexBox. I will try to finish this project in a total coding time of 2h. I hope it turns out well and that I'm happy with the final project. 

Important is to not get caught up with exact widths or pixel-lengths, but instead the general positioning and proportions between items. 

After finishing the project:
Total coding time: 1h 35 min.

Reflection:
I enjoyed making the website, even though the coloring and font-sizing/styling was a bit confusing at times. I think I improved my flexbox knowledge and understand the main block and purpose of it. 

I think I should improve my condensation of code, right now it is way longer than it needs to be - it would be good to optimize this code in the future. Otherwise I think I managed to code the website without major problems and without having google any major hints.
